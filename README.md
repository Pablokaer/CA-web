# Algomon - Website Project

## Overview
This project was developed as part of a university assessment task. The objective was to create an initial website for a video game called "Algomon." The website includes multiple pages, interactive elements, and adheres to accessibility and coding best practices.

This was my first time working with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and I had only one week to complete this project. Due to time constraints, I focused on the web version and did not have time to adapt it for mobile devices.

## Assessment Task
Students were required to develop a website that meets the following specifications:

### Requirements:
- **Pages:**
  - Home
  - About Us
  - Pictures from the Game (temporary images of rabbits used)
  - Two additional pages of our choosing
- **Navigation:**
  - A functional navigation bar for seamless site navigation
- **Interactivity:**
  - At least three different event listeners, each triggered in a unique way
- **Additional Functionality:**
  - Features beyond the basic requirements to enhance the user experience

### Constraints:
- Use of only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (No external libraries/frameworks like Bootstrap allowed)
- Code must be well-structured, with appropriate variable names and formatting
- Accessibility and UI design best practices should be followed

## Features Implemented
- **Responsive Navigation Bar** for easy site navigation
- **Dynamic Content** with interactive elements
